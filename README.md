# parallel-knn-mpi
This  implements a parallel k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to efficiently classify large datasets across multiple processes. The implementation is in Python, leveraging mpi4py for parallelism, NumPy and scipy for numerical computations, and scikit-learn for evaluating classification accuracy
